THIS PROJECT IS STILL INCOMPLETE.-

You may use this to find the Surface Area (CSA/TSA) of basic geometric shapes.

To the person reading this...

Thank you for using my code! :)
This is my first code and I am glad that you are using it.

This code uses the following languages:-
 i) HTML
 ii) JavaScript
 iii) CSS
 -
You can use this website for calculating surface area and volumes of some geometrical shapes. Really basic website but pretty useful, I guess.

Once again, thank you so much!
