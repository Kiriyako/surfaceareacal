To the person reading this...
Thank you for using my code! :)


This website allows you to compute the surface area and volumes of various geometric objects. Really simple webpage, but I believe it's really useful.

You are using my first code, and I'm really happy about that.

JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are used in this application.

This web application project is finished.

Thank you very much once more!
