To the person reading this...
Thank you for using my code! :)


You can use this website for calculating surface area and volumes of some geometrical shapes. Really basic website but pretty useful, I guess.

This is my first code and I am really glad that you are using it.

This code uses the following languages:
 i) HTML
 ii) JavaScript (internal)
 iii) CSS (internal)

I am constantly updating this website so that you can get the best user experience. Feel free to recommend any changes whenever you feel like! I'd be more than happy to review and implement those changes!

Once again, thank you so much!
